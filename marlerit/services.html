        <h1>Services we provide</h1>
        <p>At Marler IT, we offer many services to meet all of your computer needs. Our services include but are not
            limited to:</p>

        <h2>Custom PC Building</h2>
        <p>Looking for a new gaming rig or perhaps you just want your computer to be more personal? Maybe a personal
            workstation? We've got you covered! We work with all kinds of brands such as Nvidia, AMD, Intel, etc.
            They're all the same to us, and we can put them together for you. We'll even allow you in the back with us
            to watch how it is put together.</p>

        <h2>Malware Removal</h2>
        <p>So, you clicked a suspicious link that you shouldn't have. Now, your computer is spamming you with pop-ups of
            scam dating sites and tech support and you just don't know how to get rid of them. No worries! We can help
            you keep your system safe from viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. We will also include a free
            anti-virus program that will ensure your system stays secure.</p>

        <h2>Hardware Upgrades</h2>
        <p>Is your computer slower than it used to be but you just can't afford to get a new system? Well, luckily you
            don't have to! Most computer parts are interchangeable meaning they can be swapped out with a newer one.
            Now, you may be thinking, "But I don't know which parts I need to swap." Not a problem. We will run your
            system through rigorous testing to get down to the cause of its slow performance. Once we find the cause, we
            will give you some options for replacement parts and order and install them for you.</p>

        <h2>Data Recovery</h2>
        <p>Did your thumb drive with all of your important family photos over the years get corrupted? Or perhaps you
            accidentally deleted something important that you did not mean to delete. Good news, we can help you out. We
            have expert data recovery tools to help you get those files back.</p>

        <h2>Network Setup</h2>
        <p>Say you just moved into town and have no idea how to set up your Wi-Fi from your previous house. You tried
            calling your provider, but those greedy leeches want to charge you an arm and a leg for it! We can do it for
            you instead at a very reasonable price. We're not going to charge you by the hour and require a minimum of
            three hours. All you pay is one flat rate fee. No labor costs, no hidden fees, and no shady business. Just
            the rate, plus your forced donation to Uncle Sam.</p>
