        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>I work on computers, so you don’t have to! Everyone loves getting a new printer, but what they don’t love is
            setting them up. What about when you run out of space on your device but can’t delete anything because it’s
            all important? Here at Marler IT, I do that for you so you can lay back and not worry about it. I specialize
            in custom PC building, malware removal, and more. Maybe your computer is running a bit slower than normal, I
            can fix that. Book an appointment today and experience worry-free IT support!</p> <!-- change this -->

        <h3>Services</h3>
        <p>
            At Marler IT, we offer many services to meet all of your computer needs. Our services include but are not
            limited to:
            Custom PC Building: Looking for a new gaming rig or perhaps you just want your computer to be more personal?
            Maybe a personal workstation? We’ve got you covered! We work with all kinds of brands such as Nvidia, AMD,
            Intel, etc. They’re all the same to us, and we can put them together for you. We’ll even allow you in the
            back with us to watch how it is put together.

            Malware removal: So, you clicked a suspicious link that you shouldn’t have. Now, your computer is spamming
            you with pop-ups of scam dating sites and tech support and you just don’t know how to get rid of them. No
            worries! We can help you keep your system safe from viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. We will
            also include a free anti-virus program that will ensure your system stays secure.

            Hardware Upgrades: Is your computer slower than it used to be but you just can’t afford to get a new system?
            Well, luckily you don’t have to! Most computer parts are interchangeable meaning they can be swapped out
            with a newer one. Now, you may be thinking, “But I don’t know which parts I need to swap.” Not a problem. We
            will run your system through rigorous testing to get down to the cause of its slow performance. Once we find
            the cause, we will give you some options for replacement parts and order and install them for you.

            Data Recovery: Did your thumb drive with all of your important family photos over the years get corrupted?
            Or perhaps you accidentally deleted something important that you did not mean to delete. Good news, we can
            help you out. We have expert data recovery tools to help you get those files back.

            Network Setup: Say you just moved into town and have no idea how to set up your Wi-Fi from your previous
            house. You tried calling your provider, but those greedy leeches want to charge you an arm and a leg for it!
            We can do it for you instead at a very reasonable price. We’re not going to charge you by the hour and
            require a minimum of three hours. All you pay is one flat rate fee. No labor costs, no hidden fees, and no
            shady business. Just the rate, plus your forced donation to Uncle Sam.
